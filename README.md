 Class project - will see

First of all, I don't know what I am doing here to be honest but...

Here in this project, I try to implement a basic version of the New Keynesian Model, which assumes that firms have monopoly power and price-setting behavior, and that households maximize their lifetime utility subject to a budget constraint. The model includes a technology shock, which affects output, and a Calvo-style pricing mechanism, which generates inflation dynamics. The code also includes a simple investment rule, where investment is determined by a linear combination of consumption and investment in the previous period. 

This is very simple model. For both files, I will try to apply game theory which could provide provide a mathematical framework for modeling strategic interactions among economic agents, such as firms, households, and policymakers, and analyzing how these interactions affect market outcomes and welfare. 

I failed with GameTheoryAppliedNKM.ipynb and started new notebook with JustChecking.ipynb. But again for JustChecking.ipynb, looks like capital gradually drops to 0  . But in reality, firms always must have an access to capital. I need to find a better way.
